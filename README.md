### Project Overview
----------------------------------

Problem Statement
* There is always an event going around in college. These events can get lost in the WhatsApp groups where   they are usually announced. So, develop an app to showcase such events.

### Solution Description
* We tried to create an Event Manager website,where all the upcoming,ongoing and passed events are displayed.
  It would help the students to keep a track of events going on in the campus.
  The app contains an admin page to control what is to be displayed on the website i.e. Adding or Deleting the Events
  The main page contains a countdown for all the events.
